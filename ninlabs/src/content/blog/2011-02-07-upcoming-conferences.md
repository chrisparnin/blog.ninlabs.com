This winter break, I've written way too many papers.  I'm keeping this list so I can keep track where I'm submitting or may be traveling to.

Some topics on the paper's I've written: a post-mortem study of java generic adoption, API documentation and web search, using EMG to study programmers, a study about a fault localization tool's effectiveness with real programmers, code history, and software development blogs.
