## $200 Tasks

In 2013, inspired by GitHub's octocat, I too wanted a mascot. It wasn't something I _exactly_ needed, but I thought would be interesting to have. I had come across a [freelance designer](https://catplusmouse.com), and decided to splurge and commission a design. The designer did good work, and I was happy with the results. Overall, it cost $200.

There are many examples of these _$200 tasks_: a professional headshot, text transcription from audio, translation of document, or writing an article. They tend to require some level of specialized skills or equipment, are transactional in nature, and have well-defined units of output. They are the types of tasks that fit well in the side hustle ecosystem or a platform like Fiverr.

## What AI can do

Current AI technology now happens to be sufficiently capable of performing $200 tasks. 
Today, I can ask about any AI tool to help me create a mascot. I would certainly need a lot of back and forth, with the design, and I would need some last mile fixes and touch up. While I'm not exactly happy with the results, if I had these tools available in 2013, I might have just went with the generated AI slop.

In other contexts, such a programming, AI can excel in tasks, such as helping a programmer debug an exception, when given appropriate conversational cues, as demonstrated in research we recently published: [Conversational Debugging with GitHub Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/lets-fix-this-together-conversational-debugging-with-github-copilot/).

## What AI can't do, yet

We can also think of other professional services that are slightly more costly. Tasks that require more contextual and deep knowledge, good taste, and handling ambiguity. For example, create a landscape design:

When it comes to these more complex tasks outside benchmarks, AI stumbles. For example, Devin [bungling programming tasks](https://futurism.com/first-ai-software-engineer-devin-bungling-tasks), Operator [stumped by web popups](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i_am_among_the_first_people_to_gain_access_to/), ChatGPT incorrectly answering Benedict Evan's [How many people were employed as elevator operators in 1980](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/1/the-problem-with-better-models), and my personal favorite, failing to create a complex excel template from an image.

No doubt, the progress we've seen in AI so far is amazing, but economically, we're just beginning to scratch the surface of being able to solve tasks we'd pay for.
