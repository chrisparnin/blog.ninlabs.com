## $200 Tasks

In 2013, inspired by GitHub's octocat, I too wanted a mascot. It wasn't something I _exactly_ needed, but I thought would be interesting to have. I had come across a freelance designer, and decided to splurge and commission a design. The designer did good work, and I was happy with the results. Overall, it cost $200.

There are many examples of these _$200 tasks_: a professional headshot, text transcription from audio interviews, translation of document, or writing an article. They tend to require a basic level of specialized skills or equipment, transactional, and have well-defined units of output. They are the types of tasks that fit well in the side hustle ecosystem or a platform like Fiverr.

## $200 Tasks

Current AI technology now happens to be sufficiently capable of performing $200 tasks. 
Today, I can ask about any AI tool to help me create a mascot. I would certainly need a lot of back and forth, with the design, and I would need some last mile fixes and touch up. While I'm not exactly happy with the results, if I had these tools available in 2013, I might have just went with the generated AI slop. Now, a commonly requested image for Dall-e is to help create logos.

## What we can't do, yet

We can also think of other professional services that are slightly more costly. Tasks that require more contextual and deep knowledge, good taste, and handling ambiguity.

* Create a landscape design.
* Create a complex excel template from an image.
* TDB: checking census data for stuff..

Currently, AI has struggled to move beyond transactional tasks. For example, [Devin bungling tasks](https://futurism.com/first-ai-software-engineer-devin-bungling-tasks), or [Operator stumbling over web popups](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i_am_among_the_first_people_to_gain_access_to/)
