title: 'Design Comics: Illustrating Software Design'

Ever since google released a [comic](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/) describing the design of the chrome browser, I've been fascinated by the idea using comics to communicate software design.  There is something compelling about distilling down your concepts into a simple narrative. This is no easy task -- here is my first attempt, an illustration describing how the concept of code history can change how programmers work: (see the pdf version here: [[pdf]](http://blog.ninlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/codehistorycomic.pdf))

Creating the comic did not take too long (1 day to sketch, 1 day to put together).  Thankfully, I was able to find a lot of useful content from an open source design comic site (see [templates](http://www.designcomics.org/))!  Certainly, this comic is still a little rough, and a still a little cluttered, but not bad for my first one.
